              The first time we met each other was in my dreams…
The first time we ACTUALLY met each other was at work in Lacoste. I had came in for an interview when I saw Vicki for the first time. My first thoughts were “wow, she is so beautiful” but she had thought otherwise. But we never really got a chance to get close and eventually we separated and went our own paths.

              One day, I was working at Lacoste and a new hire walked in to sign papers. That’s the first time I saw Danny. To me, he was just another guy at work. I could always tell he was into me. He offered me rides home when I needed, he would compliment me on a daily basis, and he would do favours for me at work. But he was just a “bro” to me and I believed he would forever remain in the friend zone.

              We met up a year later in the exact spot we first met. But it was an entirely different story this time. I first felt something for Vicki when she gave me a hug because I got her cold medicine at work. Ever since I had this uneasy feeling when around her. But to be honest, I kind of felt like she was into me too. She tried calling me out for movies but I declined it simply cause I was second choice to the movies since her “friend” couldn’t make it. The time went by so quickly, and before I knew it I was drawn to everything about her. I knew that she was the one.

              When we met back at Lacoste a year later, something was different. I think it was mostly because he was one of few people I recognized from before and felt comfortable with. One night we were both stuck waiting for the bridge to come down on our way home. We got to talking and I realized how easy and natural it was for me to open up to him. We shared similar goals and values in life and I could really see myself being with him. I knew he felt the same way too.

              May 10th, the second most important day of my life. I was preparing to propose to Vicki and kept practicing my lines on my way to see her. I tried to keep the day ordinary to not spark any suspicion. It was a simple dinner, arcade and a walk to the park in Niagara Falls. I had hired a hidden photographer to capture the special moments. Simple plan right? Well, not exactly because the spot I planned was under construction and my photographer’s camera decided to give out. It was a total mess, nothing seemed to go according to plan. But that night, she was just too beautiful and I couldn’t hold back. I got onto my knees despite all the obstacles and I have no regrets.

              The 11th has a special meaning for us. It is the day we started dating as well as the day of Danny’s birthday. However, we were busy on the 11th, so we made dinner reservations on the 10th to make up. After dinner Danny asked “Do you want to walk down to digest?” I remember thinking, “It’s so cold, and I’m wearing a skirt and heels. He must be joking!” But thank god I agreed because that was the night Danny proposed. The biggest highlight of Danny’s proposal was the photographer. She creeped me out so much, I remember thinking, “Tonight could be my last night”. Since I had no idea Danny has hired a photographer, I was left with my imagination of a stalker in the bushes. It wasn’t the most romantic proposal but it gave me the chance to reflect on my life. lol jk
